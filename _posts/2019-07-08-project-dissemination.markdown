Our project was featured by the NABIBB recently and KBS Bayreuth was awarded a prize in recognition of the innovative concepts in e-commerce.

## "Fit for E-Commerce" featured as best-practice example
After the final report of the project at the beginning of 2019 the national agency of Germany Nationale Agentur Bildung für Europa beim Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung (NABIBB) approached the German project team in order to publish an article about the project on their website. Today this article was released and can [be found here](https://www.na-bibb.de/stories/erfahrungsberichte-erasmus-berufsbildung/berufsschule-in-bewegung/). We are very proud that our project was chosen as an example of successful project work.
