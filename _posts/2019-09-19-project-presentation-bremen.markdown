On invitation by the National Agency (NABIBB) of Germany, project coordinator Martin Kolb had the chance to present the FEC project at the "The Future is Europe â€“ mit Erasmus+ Bildung gestalten - Jahrestagung 2019" conference in Bremen. See the presentation and a few pictures.

After being featured by the NABIBB [on their website](https://www.na-bibb.de/stories/erfahrungsberichte-erasmus-berufsbildung/berufsschule-in-bewegung/) Martin was invited to present the project at the federal yearly conference of the NABIBB during the Workshop "Die Kompetenz: Digitalisierung". The concept and results of the project were discussed as well as general implications of digitalization on vocational education in the field of commercial vocations. Below you can find the short presentation about the project:
